Every Sunday for the past year, they have hosted a dinner party, inviting a friend over to have an open-minded discussion about whatever topics are of interest. On a dark and stormy night when Pete was supposed to bring a friend for one of those dinners, he instead comes home with Zachary Cody, who rescued a stranded Pete whose car broke down. They invite Zach to stay for dinner instead of Pete's missing friend. They soon find out that Zach is among other things a racist neo-Nazi, which brings up a potentially dangerous situation for Jewish Marc and black Luke. After some physical altercations and verbal threats, Marc ends up stabbing Zach dead out of what he considers self-defense. As the friends discuss what to do about Zach, they finally come to the conclusion that in killing Zach, they have done society a service. So they ponder 'why not invite other ultra-conservatives with extreme views to dinner to do the same to them'? Several dinner parties and deaths later, they think they've hit the jackpot when they meet powerful ultra-conservative broadcaster Norman Arbuthnot, who they invite for dinner. But the friends' plans start to unravel when they can't agree on whether certain of their guests deserve to die.

'Hauling' reveals the day-to-day life of this man, a father to over 27 children, and of many others who make their living out of collecting and recycling material that others have thrown out. In order to do this, Claudinei routinely visits the downtown neighborhood of Santa Efigênia in his lime-green VW bus. A regular visitor for over 5 years, he is well known by the local shopkeepers and residents, who often donate not only the usual cardboard and plastic, but also other used goods, such as computer parts which he restores and sells. Claudinei and his family serve as a symbol of the thousands of people in Brazil who resort to recycling in order to make a living and suffer prejudice and discrimination as a result. This film shows us the intimate workings of that universe in an effort to stimulate recycling and to expose these individuals as followers of a noble and respectable way of life.","Language":"Portuguese","Country":"Brazil","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MzE0MDUyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDczODExNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"22","imdbID":"tt1531677","Type":"movie","Response":"True"},

Col. Von Meyer is about to pass the secret of the weapon to Col. Noyoma, as Japan is still at war, and will use it to revenge their recent losses. However, Field Marshal Von Runzel arrives with precise orders to the contrary: the Japanese shall not have the secret weapon, for an underground Nazi ring is to use it later in another attempt to destroy all the Allied Nations, and conquer the world in a third Worl War. Von Meyer decides to create a diversion, and to offer the Japanese scientist and officers some \"evening entertainment\" at the German Officers' Club. Thaler, the female German Officer, is to bring in a number of women - arrested on trumped up charges at the Shanghai University - dress them up, and force them to service the lusty Japanese officers.

    {"Title":"The Interrupters","Year":"2011","Rated":"UNRATED","Released":"12 Aug 2011","Runtime":"125 min","Genre":"Documentary, Crime","Director":"Steve James","Writer":"Alex Kotlowitz (New York Times magazine article)","Actors":"Tio Hardiman, Ameena Matthews, Toya Batey, Cobe Williams","Plot":"The Interrupters tells the moving and surprising stories of three Violence Interrupters who try to protect their Chicago communities from the violence they once employed. From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz, this film is an unusually intimate journey into the stubborn, persistence of violence in our cities. Shot over the course of a year out of Kartemquin Films, The Interrupters captures a period in Chicago when it became a national symbol for the violence in our cities. During that period, the city was besieged by high-profile incidents, most notably the brutal beating of Derrion Albert, a Chicago High School student, whose death was caught on videotape. The film's main subjects work for an innovative organization, CeaseFire, which believes that the spread of violence mimics the spread of infectious diseases, and so the treatment should be similar: go after the most infected, and stop the infection at its source. The singular mission of the \"Violence Interrupters\" - who have credibility on the streets because of their own personal histories -- is to intervene in conflicts before they explode into violence. In The Interrupters, Ameena Matthews, whose father is Jeff Fort, one of the city's most notorious gang leaders, was herself a drug ring enforcer. But having children and finding solace in her Muslim faith pulled her off the streets and grounded her. In the wake of Derrion Albert's death, Ameena becomes a close confidante to his mother, and helps her through her grieving. Ameena, who is known among her colleagues for her fearlessness, befriends a feisty teenaged girl who reminds her of herself at that age. The film follows that friendship over the course of many months, as Ameena tries to nudge the troubled girl in the right direction. Cobe Williams, scarred by his father's murder, was in and out of prison, until he had had enough. His family - particularly a young son - helped him find his footing. Cobe disarms others with his humor and his general good nature. His most challenging moment comes when he has to confront a man so bent on revenge that Cobe has to pat him down to make sure he's put away his gun. Like Ameena, he gets deeply involved in the lives of those he encounters, including a teenaged boy just out of prison and a young man from his old neighborhood who's squatting in a foreclosed home. Eddie Bocanegra is haunted by a murder he committed when he was seventeen. His CeaseFire work is a part of his repentance for what he did. Eddie is most deeply disturbed by the aftereffects of the violence on children, and so he spends much of his time working with younger kids in an effort to both keep them off the streets and to get support to those who need it - including a 16-year-old girl whose brother died in her arms. Soulful and empathic, Eddie, who learned to paint in prison, teaches art to children, trying to warn them of the debilitating trauma experienced by those touched by the violence. The Interrupters follows Ameena, Cobe and Eddie as they go about their work, and while doing so reveals their own inspired journeys of hope and redemption. The film attempts to make sense of what CeaseFire's Tio Hardiman calls, simply, \"the madness\".","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"9 wins & 16 nominations.","Poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MjM0ODcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg1MjIwNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Metascore":"86","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"3,102","imdbID":"tt1319744","Type":"movie","Response":"True"},

The problems of the British may be ending but for the new state of Israel they're just beginning. Israel is surrounded by hostile Arab nations and must fight to defend itself from aggression. The Israeli defense force, the Haganah, has received intelligence that Arab forces, Syria in particular, are employing former German Panzer commander General Gustav Schiller to train them in tank tactics against Israel. The Israelis also learn that General Schiller's wife, Judith Auerbach Schiller, is a Jewish woman who was betrayed by her husband and was left to die in a concentration camp. Judith has survived the camp and is searching for her husband to exact revenge and to locate their son. The Haganah decides to find Judith and use her knowledge in order to locate the general, positively identify him and make him reveal the Syrian attack plans. Judith is smuggled into Israel and hidden in a kibbutz under the care of Haganah commander Aaron Stein. Life in the kibbutz is not easy for Judith, work is hard, safety is not guaranteed and she grows impatient and frustrated. Haganah leaders suggest to her that the British may have a file on her husband, like on most war criminals, and it may contain his latest whereabouts. However, this means Judith may have to ingratiate herself with the local British commander, Major Lawton, who has access to the files. When Major Lawton finally succumbs to the charms of sensual Judith he hands over the file to her. Unfortunately, General Gustav Schiller's last whereabouts are in Damascus, Syria. The Israeli intelligence team decides to go into the lion's den and try to capture the German General. Judith is asked to go along with the team, in order to identify the General, but she is only thinking of revenge.","Language":"English","Country":"Israel, UK, USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTA0ODQwNTc4NjheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU1MDg5NTAx._V1_SX300.jpg","Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.9","imdbVotes":"159","imdbID":"tt0060568","Type":"movie","Response":"True"},
